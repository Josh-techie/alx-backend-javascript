## ES6 Promises:

- This project is designed to enhance your understanding and proficiency in handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript using ES6 Promises. The project emphasizes key concepts such as Promises, then, resolve, catch methods, the every method of the Promise object, error handling with throw/try, the await operator, and the usage of async functions.

## Ressources:

- [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
- [JavaScript Promise: An introduction](https://web.dev/promises/)
- [Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
- [Async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
- [Throw / Try](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)


### Advanced to epxlore soon.....

0. **Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep**: Return a Promise using the following prototype function `getResponseFromAPI()`

   - Redirect to file: [0-promise.js](./0-promise.js)

1. **Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it**: Return a promise with resolving and rejecting conditions based on a boolean parameter.

- Redirect to file: [1-promise.js](./1-promise.js)

2. **Catch me if you can!**: Append handlers to a function prototype that returns an object when the promise resolves or an empty Error object when it rejects.

- Redirect to file: [2-then.js](./2-then.js)

3. **Handle multiple successful promises**: Call two functions that return promises and log specific values from their resolutions.

- Redirect to file: [3-all.js](./3-all.js)

4. **Simple promise**: Write a function that returns a resolved promise with specific object attributes.

- Redirect to file: [4-user-promise.js](./4-user-promise.js)

5. **Reject the promises**: Write a function that returns a promise rejecting with a specific error message.

- Redirect to file: [5-photo-reject.js](./5-photo-reject.js)

6. **Handle multiple promises** Call two functions that return promises, and return an array with the results of both promises.

- Redirect to file: [6-final-user.js](./6-final-user.js)

7. **Load balancer**: Write a function that accepts two promises and returns the result of the promise that resolves first.

- Redirect to file: [7-load_balancer.js](./7-load_balancer.js)

8. **Throw error / try catch**: Write a function that divides two numbers and throws an error if the denominator is 0.

- Redirect to file: [8-try.js](./8-try.js)

9. **Throw an error**: Write a function that executes a math function and appends the result or error message to an array.

- Redirect to file: [9-try.js](./9-try.js)

### Advanced Tasks:

10. **Await / Async**: Call two async functions and return an object with their responses. If one of the functions fails, return an empty object.

- Redirect to file: [100-await.js](./100-await.js)
