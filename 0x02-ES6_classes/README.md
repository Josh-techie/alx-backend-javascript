# ALX Backend JavaScript - ES6 Classes Project

## Overview

This repository contains the solution to the ALX Africa Intranet project on ES6 classes in JavaScript. The project focuses on understanding and implementing concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using ES6 classes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different tasks, each addressing specific requirements related to defining classes, adding methods, using getters and setters, implementing static methods, inheritance, and more.

### Task Descriptions

1. **ClassRoom (Task 0)**

   - Implement a class named ClassRoom with a specified attribute.

2. **Initialize ClassRooms (Task 1)**

   - Import the ClassRoom class and implement a function to initialize an array of ClassRoom objects with specific sizes.

3. **HolbertonCourse (Task 2)**

   - Implement a class named HolbertonCourse with constructor attributes, getters, and setters.

4. **Currency (Task 3)**

   - Implement a class named Currency with attributes, getters, setters, and a method to display the full currency.

5. **Pricing (Task 4)**

   - Import the Currency class and implement a Pricing class with constructor attributes, getters, setters, and methods.

6. **Building (Task 5)**

   - Implement an abstract class named Building with constructor attributes and a requirement for subclasses to implement a specific method.

7. **SkyHighBuilding (Task 6)**

   - Import the Building class and implement a subclass named SkyHighBuilding with additional attributes and a method override.

8. **Airport (Task 7)**

   - Implement a class named Airport with constructor attributes and a customized toString method.

9. **HolbertonClass (Task 8)**

   - Implement a class named HolbertonClass with constructor attributes and support for casting to Number or String.

10. **Car (Task 10)**
    - Implement a class named Car with constructor attributes and a method to clone an object.
