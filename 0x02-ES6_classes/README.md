# ALX Backend JavaScript - ES6 Classes Project

## Overview

This repository contains the solution to the ALX Africa Intranet project on ES6 classes in JavaScript. The project focuses on understanding and implementing concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using ES6 classes.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different tasks, each addressing specific requirements related to defining classes, adding methods, using getters and setters, implementing static methods, inheritance, and more.

### Tasks

0. **ClassRoom**: Implement a class named ClassRoom with a specified attribute.

   - Redirect to file: [0-classroom.js](./0-classroom.js)

1. **Initialize ClassRooms**: Import the ClassRoom class and implement a function to initialize an array of ClassRoom objects with specific sizes.

   - Redirect to file: [1-make_classrooms.js](./1-make_classrooms.js)

2. **HolbertonCourse**: Implement a class named HolbertonCourse with constructor attributes, getters, and setters.

   - Redirect to file: [2-hbtn_course.js](./2-hbtn_course.js)

3. **Currency**: Implement a class named Currency with attributes, getters, setters, and a method to display the full currency.

   - Redirect to file: [3-currency.js](./3-currency.js)

4. **Pricing**: Import the Currency class and implement a Pricing class with constructor attributes, getters, setters, and methods.

   - Redirect to file: [4-pricing.js](./4-pricing.js)

5. **Building**: Implement an abstract class named Building with constructor attributes and a requirement for subclasses to implement a specific method.

   - Redirect to file: [5-building.js](./5-building.js)

6. **SkyHighBuilding**: Import the Building class and implement a subclass named SkyHighBuilding with additional attributes and a method override.

   - Redirect to file: [6-sky_high.js](./6-sky_high.js)

7. **Airport**: Implement a class named Airport with constructor attributes and a customized toString method.

   - Redirect to file: [7-airport.js](./7-airport.js)

8. **HolbertonClass**: Implement a class named HolbertonClass with constructor attributes and support for casting to Number or String.

   - Redirect to file: [8-hbtn_class.js](./8-hbtn_class.js)

9. **Car**: Implement a class named Car with constructor attributes and a method to clone an object.
   - Redirect to file: [9-hoisting.js](./9-hoisting.js)

### Advanced Tasks:

10. **Car**: Implement a class named Car with constructor attributes. Add a method to clone an object.

- Redirect to file: [10-car.js](./10-car.js)

11. **Hosting**: Implement a class named `Hoisting` with a static method `hoistTest` and a method `nonHoistTest`. Demonstrate the difference between hoisting and non-hoisting.

- Redirect to file: [100-evcar.js](./100-evcar.js)
