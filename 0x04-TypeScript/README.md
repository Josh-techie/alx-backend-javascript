## Typescript
TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. Developed and maintained by **Microsoft**, TypeScript enhances JavaScript by introducing features such as static types, interfaces, and advanced tooling. It aims to improve code maintainability, catch errors during development, and provide a more structured approach to building large-scale applications.
